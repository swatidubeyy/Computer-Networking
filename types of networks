                               1).Wired Network:--->>>>
                                                    As we all know, “wired” refers to any physical medium made up of cables.
                                                    Copper wire, twisted pair, or fiber optic cables are all options. 
                                                    A wired network employs wires to link devices to the Internet or another network, 
                                                    such as laptops or desktop PCs.


                               2).Wireless Network:--->>>>                                                    
                                                    “Wireless” means without wire, media that is made up of electromagnetic waves (EM Waves) or infrared waves.
                                                    Antennas or sensors will be present on all wireless devices. 
                                                    Cellular phones, wireless sensors, TV remotes, satellite disc receivers, 
                                                    and laptops with WLAN cards are all examples of wireless devices. 
                                                    For data or voice communication, a wireless network uses radio frequency waves rather than wires.




2. Division based on area covered -->>>

                               1).Local Area Network (LAN):--->>>>
                                                    A LAN is a network that covers an area of around 10 kilometers. 
                                                    For example, a college network or an office network.
                                                    advantage : speed , security , cost , resource sharing.
                                
                                
                               2).Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):--->>>> 
                                                    MAN refers to a network that covers an entire city.
                                                    For example : consider the cable television network.
                                
                                
                               3).Wide Area Network (WAN):--->>>>
                                                    WAN refers to a network that connects countries or continents. 
                                                    For example, the Internet allows users to access a distributed system called www from anywhere in the globe.
                                                    
                                                    
                               4).Personal area network (PAN):--->>>>
                                                    A personal area network (PAN) connects electronic devices within a user's immediate area. 
                                                    The size of a PAN ranges from a few centimeters to a few meters. 
                                                    One of the most common real-world examples of a PAN is the connection between a Bluetooth earpiece and a smartphone.
                                                    
                                                    
                               5).Storage area network (SAN):--->>>>                   
                                                    The main aim of SAN is to transfer the data between the server and storage device.
                                                    It also allows for transferring the data between the storage systems. 
                                        
                                        
                               6). Campus area network (CAN):--->>>>          
                                                    Campus Area Network is network of interconnected Local Area Networks where these LANs are connected 
                                                    via Switches and routers and create a single network like CAN. 
                                                    Campus Area Network covers areas of around 1 to 5 km range and it can be both wired or wireless connectivity.
                                                    
                                                    
                              7). Body area network (BAN):--->>>>
                                                    A BAN, or body area network, is an area connected through extremely 
                                                    low-range wireless communication, all within the vicinity of the human body. 
                                                    Devices connected to a BAN could include smartwatches, surgically implanted medical devices, and fitness armbands.


                              8).Near-me Network(NAN):--->>>>
                                                    An informal type of network, a NAN is a near-me network, or a network of devices informally connected by their proximity to one another.
                                                    An example of this could be a business meeting in which various colleagues are sitting at the same conference table, sharing files to one another’s devices.
                                                    They could all be connected to the Internet through different means – cellular, WiFi,
                                                    or wired connection – but they are a part of the same informal network because they are sharing resources with one another.
                              
                              
                              9).Home area network (HAN):--->>>>
                                                    A HAN, or home area network, is a network connecting devices within a home. These networks are a type of LAN. 
                                                    All the devices inside the household, including computers, smartphones, game consoles, televisions, 
                                                    and home assistants that are connected to the router are a part of the HAN.
                                
                                
                                
                                
3. Based on types of communication -->>>

                              1).Point To Point networks:--->>>>
                                                    Point-to-Point networking is a type of data networking that establishes a direct link between two networking nodes.
                                                    A direct link between two devices, such as a computer and a printer, is known as a point-to-point connection.

                              2).Broadcast networks:--->>>>  
                                                    In broadcast networks, a signal method in which numerous parties can hear a single sender. 
                                                    Radio stations are an excellent illustration of the “Broadcast Network” in everyday life. 
                                                    The radio station is a sender of data/signal in this scenario, and data is only intended to travel in one direction.
                                                    Away from the radio transmission tower, to be precise.




4. Based on type of architecture -->>>

                              1).P2P Networks:--->>>> 
                                                    Computers with similar capabilities and configurations are referred to as peers.
                                                    “Peer to Peer” is the abbreviation for “peer to peer.” 
                                                    The “peers” in a peer-to-peer network are computer systems that are connected to each other over the Internet.
                                                    Without the use of a central server, files can be shared directly between systems on the network.
                              
                              
                              2).Client – Server Networks:--->>>>
                                                    Each computer or process on the network is either a client or a server in a client-server architecture (client/server).
                                                    The client asks services from the server, which the server provides. 
                                                    Servers are high-performance computers or processes that manage disc drives (file servers), 
                                                    printers (print servers), or network traffic (network servers).
                                                    
                                                    
                             3).Hybrid Networks:--->>>> 
                                                    The hybrid model refers to a network that uses a combination of client-server and peer-to-peer architecture. 
                                                    Eg: Torrent.
